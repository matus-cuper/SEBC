## Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
```
Very useful and quite difficult. I think the first day was the most difficult, because of initial cluster setup and time pressure, but we catched up.
```

## Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
```
Least familiar for me was Sentry tool and API. But API is easy googleable. The most one was a initial setup, because of testing purposes I walk through it several times.
```

## Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
```
I think the most useful topic was a security, but it may be a little bit better, because LDAP setup is missing. But still it was great experience and I learn a lot about security, Kerberos, etc.
At the other hand creating new users and new charts for them in Cloudera Manager are not useful for me at all.
```

## How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
```
Because of testing purposes it will take about one month. Also I need get deeper in Sentry, because I saw it for the first time last week.
